          Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that
          could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am
          profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.<br><br>

          The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave
          me feeling cleaner for having watched them.<br><br>

          I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work
          at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons,
          she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes
          me feel better." At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things
          I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I
          remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better
          with every showing.<br><br>

          No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.<br><br>

          The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by
          it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or
          this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential
          motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie
          like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.<br><br>

          I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses
          friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it
          gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you
          don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.<br><br>

          It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of
          outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why
          this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let
          its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.<br><br>

          Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is
          talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.<br><br>

          This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation
          and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.<br><br>

          Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest
          performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me
          smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is
          gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding
          played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost
          hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying
          to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we
          have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great
          performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been
          "institutionalized".<br><br>

          The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with
          the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of
          the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second
          chance.<br><br>

          Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most
          inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want. <br><br>
