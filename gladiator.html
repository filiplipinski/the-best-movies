          Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you
          can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost. <br><br>

          Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his
          troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors
          today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders. <br><br>

          Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the
          film to new perspectives. <br><br>

          Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in.
          Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator. <br><br>

          But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in
          with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work
          within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes. <br><br>

          Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2
          and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL
          HAIL MAXIMUS! <br><br>

          I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire
          Hollywood has ever put out. People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in
          quality. The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I
          had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie.
          Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history. He played his character as if
          it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have
          ever seen. The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in
          recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting
          everyday life. If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect
          depiction.

          An intense Roman epic, a la "Ben-Hur" or "Spartacus," it was nice to see something like this made again. It
          had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this. <br><br>

          Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to
          fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true
          formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did,
          such as "Braveheart" or "The Patriot." <br><br>

          The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors
          of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself "on the map" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil
          "Commodus." He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to
          the rest of the cast, too. <br><br>

          Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s. <br><br>
