          What is going on with the IMDb user reviews lately? It's like the masses can no longer be trusted. In the
          last month, the users have decreed "Airbender" the worst abomination ever, when in fact it's just an average
          movie. User reviews raved over "Despicable Me", when it was about as entertaining as a "Dexter's Lab" rerun.
          And now? "Inception" is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a very creative and
          interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. The problem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a
          dream? or a dream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they're dreaming about parallel
          universes while pretending to dream) is sooner or later you stop caring about the actual action because it's
          a dream. So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the pouring rain, and the 30 minutes
          spent watching these guys shoot up a ski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what's-his-name float
          around a hotel just didn't do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd greatest movie ever? You must be
          dreaming. <br><br>

          Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all
          are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible. <br><br>

          This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way,
          something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for
          making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not
          think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is
          really the centre of this film, it is the focus. <br><br>

          I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget,
          because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick
          could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness. <br><br>

          I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing
          I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I
          didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not,
          then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued. <br><br>

          The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to
          constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything,
          all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you
          have seen this you will now what I am talking about. <br><br>

          All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact
          he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his
          performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy
          gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass. <br><br>

          I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single
          frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision
          yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. <br><br>

          Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for
          drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true
          original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels. <br><br>

          To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As
          Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are
          prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in
          technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's
          storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't
          expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply
          blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the
          film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer,
          incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set
          pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael
          Bay. <br><br>

          Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot
          dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water.
          This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3. <br><br>
