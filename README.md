# the-best-movies
IT Project for University made by Filip Lipi≈Ñski. LIVE: https://filiplipinski.github.io/the-best-movies/

Site originally was written in PHP, it was connecting with MySQL database where all data about movies were stored. 
I can't upload dynamic site, so changed code to only html, but it require to create more .html files (intouchables.html, gladiator.html etc)

The original site (with PHP and MySQL) you can check here: http://thebestmovies.5v.pl/
If you want to see my PHP code, you can see it, i uploaded .php files to folder: "code_with_PHP (only read)" and my .sql database

Site looks good only for DESKTOPS because responsiveness wasn't neccessary to get the best mark in the University.
